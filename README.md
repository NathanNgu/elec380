# ELEC380 Introduction to Neuroengineering

This repository contains example code and data associated with the course ELEC380-Introduction
to Neuroengineering at Rice University.

## Getting up and running with Python
If you do not have Python on your computer, I recommend either using Google Colaboratory or installing [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) 
and the [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/mamba.html) Python environment tool. You can then create an environment for this class with
a command like `mamba create -n elec380 python=3.10 numpy scipy matplotlib jupyter`. Here is a [tutorial for Windows](https://christianjmills.com/posts/mamba-getting-started-tutorial-windows/). Mac and Linux are similar (but perhaps easier). We are working on getting some videos uploaded for Python review.
