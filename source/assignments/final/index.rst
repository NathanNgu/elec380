Final Project
##########

*The goal of the final project is for you to explore a few of the topics in the course in a bit of 
depth. You need to choose one of the three sub-assignments below. You may choose to do additional
problems as extra credit. Problems 1 and 2 are essay problems (~1000 words), and problem 3 involves 
coding. In addition to the references given, it is expected that you will cite at least 3 other papers. 
Make sure to cite your sources and include a reference section/bibliography at the end. Feel
free to include figures from sources that you cite or create your own.  You are 
welcome to propose an alternative topic/problem -- please do so before the end of classes.*

#. *Technologies for measuring the activity of all the neurons in the brain.*

    In class, we discussed a variety of techniques to measure the activity of neurons in the brain.
    Imagine that you've been given a nearly infinite budget by a philanthropist to embark on a
    ten year program to try to simultaneously record the activity of as many neurons in the brain of a mouse
    as possible. Would you fund electrode development, microscopy techniques, other approaches
    or all of the above? What are the benefits and limitations of each approach? What do you
    think is currently the biggest gap in our technologies in terms of measuring a specific part
    or fraction of the brain?

#. *Artificial vision: the challenge of precisely controlling neural circuits*

    Imagine that you want to create a brain implant that will produce artificial vision.
    Specifically, assume that your goal is to precisely control the activity of individual
    neurons in primary visual cortex. Compare optogenetic solutions with solutions based on 
    electrodes. Questions that you likely want to address: What are the benefits and drawbacks 
    of each approach in terms of: 

    * controlling neural activity precisely, 
    * targeting the right neurons, 
    * logistically placing/controlling the interface (i.e., surgeries, implants, system size/weight), 
    * ethical concerns? 
    * other challenges

#. *Decoding place cell activity*

    In class, we used Bayes rule to decode the choices of reaches. In this problem, you will use
    Bayes rule to decode the position of a rat in a maze.
