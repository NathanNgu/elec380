Homework 1

*This problem set is due Monday (9/5/2022) at noon. Please turn in your
work by uploading to Canvas. If you have questions, please post them on the
course forum, rather than emailing the course staff. This will allow other
students with the same question to see the response and any ensuing discussion.
The first goal of this problem set is to review the concept that complex
operations involve distributed action in the brain and to think about how best
we can understand the process of cortical computaiton. The second goal is to
review molecular neurobiology.*

1. *Organization of the brain - short answer (a few sentences, 5 pts)*
   
   In the 1860s, Pierre Paul Broca described how patients with lesions in the posterior left
   frontal lobe (what is now called "Broca's area") were capable of understanding language but
   not speaking.  

   How do the symptoms of lesions in Wernicke's area differ from those in Broca's area?

   What happens to deaf patients ability to communicate in sign language when they suffer
   damage to Broca's or Wernicke's areas?

2. *The Stroop Effect (5 pts)* 

   Please take the Stroop effect test at
   `http://www.math.unt.edu/~tam/SelfTests/StroopEffects.html <http://www.math.unt.edu/~tam/SelfTests/StroopEffects.html>`_.
   What was your performance time for the congruent and incongruent samples? What factors do
   you think might affect your performance? How do you think you could improve?  For full
   credit, record your answer on the Canvas HW1-Stroop Effect Survey.



3. *Distributed Functions (not graded)* 

   Watch the Neuralink "Progress Update"
   `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVvmgjBL74w <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVvmgjBL74w>`_.
   What examples of applications of their technology would be made challenging by
   the distributed aspects of some mental processes?

5. *Similarity of Function Across Species (10 pts)* 

   The Nobel Prize in 2014 was awarded for
   the discovery of two different patterns of neural responses in memory-related regions of the brain.
   Here is an overview: `https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627314010903 
   <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627314010903>`_
   Recently, a similar pattern was observed in the brains of birds 
   `http://science.sciencemag.org/content/373/6552/343.long 
   <http://science.sciencemag.org/content/373/6552/343.long>`_. 
   
   What is the name given to the receptive fields of this type of neural activity?
   This activity was not observed in all types of birds. Why do the authors speculate this is?

6. *Attention and Top-Down vs Bottom-Up (not graded)* 

   View the double drift illusion here:
   `https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982219313739 
   <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982219313739>`_
   Why do you think your perception of the drift differs when you look at the fixation point
   versus looking at the drift stimulus?
   
8. *Passive Membrane and the Hodgkin Huxley Model of Action Potentials (40 pts)*


     **a.** Use the Nernst equation to fill in the individual equilibrium potentials for potassium, sodium,
     and chloride in the table below. (You might find `this notebook helpful<Nernst and GHK Equations.ipynb >`.)

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Ion", "Extracellular Conc.", "Intracellular Conc.", "Permeability", "Equilibrium Potential"
   :width: 30%

   K+, 8 mM, 150 mM, 1
   Na+, 154 mM, 20 mM, 0.04 
   Cl-, 123 mM, 4.2 mM, 0.45 

     **b.** Use the GHK equation to find the net equilibrium membrane potential of a neuron with the given
     passive properties.

     **c.** Imagine that the extracellular potassium rises to 14 mM (as can happen, for example after a 
     traumatic brain injury). What will the new Nernst equilibrium potential for potassium be?

8. *Passive Membrane and the Hodgkin Huxley Model of Action Potentials (40 pts)*

   Refer to *Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience* (Dayan and Abbot) Chapter 5.  Download and
   run the HodgkinHuxley notebook `here<https://elec380.pages.dev/assignments/hw1/HodgkinHuxley.ipynb>`_ . 
   
     **a.** Notice that in the simulation, with an extended period of current injection, multiple 
     action potentials will occur in a row. What is the rate at which they occur? (You may find it
     helpful to lengthen the period of current injection!)

     **b.** Imagine that something happens such that the extracellular concentration of potassium
     rises transiently as described in problem 7. What happens to the neuron if the equilibrium
     potential for K falls to -62 mV?

     **c.** Restore the equilibrium potential to -77 mV. To decrease the rate at which action potentials
     occur, should you increase the potassium conductance ($\bar{g}_K$) or decrease it?

     **d.** In the sequence of action potentials generated by a continuous injection of current, the
     peak depolarization happens only for the first action potential. If the current injection drops
     to zero, and then you deliver a second 2 ms injection of current, the action potential amplitude
     can be restored to maximum. What is the minimum delay between current 2 ms pulses for which the
     action potentials will all be the same?
