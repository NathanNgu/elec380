ELEC380/NEUR383 Introduction To Neuroengineering
================================================

Why do “Neuroengineering”?
##########################

The activity of a complex network of billions of interconnected neurons underlies our ability to sense, represent and store the details of experienced life, and enables us to interact with our environment and other organisms. Modern neuroscience techniques enable us to access this activity, and thus to begin to understand the processes whereby individual neurons work together to enable complex behaviors. **Neuroengineering** is the field of research devoted to developing complex technologies to increase this understanding and potentially enable new therapeutical interactions. In particular, **neuroengineers** (1) design electrical/optical/biochemical systems which interact with neural circuits by reading out and writing in information and (2) develop new quantitative approaches to process neural signals.

What does ELEC380/NEUR383 cover?
################################

This class will cover a range of techniques and their application to basic neuroscience and therapeutic neural interfaces. Topics include an introduction to neural circuits from an quantitative perspective, basic signal processing in the time domain, frequency domain, and point process domain and an introduction to genetic and optical tools for interrogating neural circuits. This course is designed for students with experience in progamming in the Python language, but should be accessible for students with only Matlab experience. The course is designed for students without prior neurobiology coursework. Some experience with electrical circuits (i.e., capacitors) and simple differential equations is expected.
